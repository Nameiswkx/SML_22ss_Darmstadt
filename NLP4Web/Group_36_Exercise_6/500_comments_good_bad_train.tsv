This is way more than what I get in India .But do you think this is a good salary in Qatar . I am married and my wife would join me.How much would I be able to save on average a month. Thank you in advance.	For single it is okay. But for married you won't be saving anything. 1000-1500 living expenses is good for one person only. House rent and food will eat most of your salary. Transportation or car maintenance and education fees is an additional burden to your meagre salary.	Good

The only way to determine if it's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save.

It's naturally occurring when you're in the sunlight. I strongly suggest that you take a walk after you eat right before sunset. Make sure that you eat calcium containing products (milk, cheese) as well as items from all the food groups (vegetables, meat, dairy). If you are lactose intolerant, try taking calcium supplements. It's best if u allow your body to produce vitamin D naturally instead of taking medication.	Good

You only need to fill the car aircon if it's not working. The gas should not leak out in normal use, or disappear, or shrink. If your aircon has stopped working duev to a gas leak, you can re-fill it which may last a few weeks or so - but repairs are needed if your gas is gone. Should be about QR150 to fill - but it will quickly become cheaper to fix the leak.	Good

You should be able to do the same by following these two simple steps, 1. Take 75% of the total amount you want to put into this scheme into a high yielding fixed deposit scheme with any major like CBQ. 2. The remaining 25%,invest in equities yourself. If the markets do well, you will make much more than you will with the notes, if the markets fare very badly, you will still have earned interest on the fixed deposit to offset the 25% loss on your equity investment portfolio.

I've been using Volvos for about 5 years now both in Qatar and in the UK and they have proven to be very reliable cars. The cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for. Regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years, I think that person was talking about American cars.	Good

Thanks	Sir.fin.unfortunately its sad you live this country for so long and you dont know the facts about this place. Expats CAN buy property is designated areas i.e not only in The Pearl. Its true the cost of an apartment in the Pearl is more than 1M.

Even in Muntaza area, some time back, Al Asmakh was selling flats. Anyways, you might own the property but you will not get any residence permit against that property. this means, if/when you job is finished from here, you will not able to enter in the country based on your property here. I hope your passport is entitled for on arrival visit visa but things can go bad any time. As Canada's case! All the best.	Good

Honestly, I've been searching hard for the same thing. I have not tried the South African place at Villagio yet though I've heard its good. But still, I don't think its dry aged. I have had steak at the restaurant at the top of la cigale which was actually incredible.

Q2141	Q2141_C1	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	Just bring your stuff, it will work either within the 'European' sockets or you get adadpters.	Good
Q2141	Q2141_C2	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	3 pin plugs will work in Qatar no problem as the sockets are the same (they were the last time I was there in 2004) TV am not sure as we bought ours in Qatar. We bought a DVD player in Qatar and it worked fine in the UK with UK bought DVDs but again they are cheap enough to buy in Qatar.	Good
Q2141	Q2141_C3	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	Plug sockets here are all 3-pin UK style. However, you might want to bring a stock of 3-pin to 2-pin adaptors with you because anything you by out here will be 2-pin, and the adapters you buy here are very low quality and I've seen many catch fire or melt.	Good
Q2141	Q2141_C5	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	I expect plug sockets are 3-pin cos Qatar used to be protected by the British. Just a guess. Appliances are 2-pin cos they come from Asia I think. It's juts one of many wonderful things that defies logic here in Qatar. You'll need adapters that plug into the 3-pin wall socket and take a 2-pin plug.	Good
Q2141	Q2141_C6	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	Have some patience and change the plugs on new items to 3-pin plugs. I hate the adapters here, as previously mentioned the quality is rubbish and they can melt.	Good
Q2141	Q2141_C7	Moving to Qatar	Plugs from UK?	Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks	The same applies to the 3-pin plugs you buy here as the adapters - they are cheap and prone to catching fire. Best to bring your own from the UK.	Good

Also, if you get in an accident- the car has insurance, but from what I've seen- the car rental companies require you to pay 2,500- even its not your fault. furthermore, the insurance will not cover everything, and you may have to pay an additional amount. please be careful :)	Good

I am being offered a gross salary of 8000 QR by a MEP Contracting Company. I am still negotiating my terms @10K QR. Need advise from the experienced lot ?? What about family visa in Qatar ? How can bring my wife to Qatar ? Would really appreciate some great advise.	Firstly I take it this is 8000 per month? If so then NO don't accept unless the contractor provides you with housing at the VERY LEAST. Rent in Doha is very expensive. The average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in doha with furniture is at least 6000 QR a month. As for family Visa's I don't know enough to give you accurate information. But if you have Children who are at school then you would also want the contractor to pay tutition fees as school fees are expensive as well.	Good
