What are the benefits of living in an apartment block to living in a villa or compound. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks!	Well, as of our experience, Doha is the WORST place for Todds and kids. First of all, there aren't many playgrounds only couple but they are always so crowded and the kids are so agressive you don't even want your kid to go near them, the kids here have no respect and no manner, beside it gets super HOT in summer so even forget about the parks. For sure its better to live in a Villa. I would not recommend living here unless you make some good money to save for your future.	Good

As the current rate is closer to QR5 to 1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.	Good

As his contract says that either from both sides the employment can be terminated in 3 days during probation. Then what can be his Job security after visa is transfered ? Thanx in Adv.	Well there is something called a Borrowing card where the sponsor allows him to work for another for 6 months and this is renewable for another Six months.

I am not sure about this agent whether this is a fake or real? Please tell me if this is ok to go ahead with such an offer? or Is there any place where I can verify about this agent Thanks in advance	Bro, My piece of advice , advance rental payment of 1 year is not practical and very risky. I highly suggest that you look somewhere else.
